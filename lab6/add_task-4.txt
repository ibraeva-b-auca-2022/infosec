4. Prepare a short summary on the importance of permission auditing and least-privilege principles.

Permission auditing and the least-privilege principle are important for keeping a Linux system secure and stable.
Auditing means checking who has access to what, and making sure no one has unnecessary or risky permissions.
It helps detect mistakes, like files that are world-writable or scripts that anyone can execute.

The least-privilege principle means giving users only the permissions they really need to do their work — nothing more.
This reduces damage if an account is hacked or a command is run by mistake.
Even small permission issues can lead to data leaks or system compromise if not managed properly.

By auditing permissions regularly and following the least-privilege rule, administrators can keep systems organized, safe, and harder to break.
It’s basically about control and prevention, not fixing things after they go wrong.
