4. Document how permissions affect collaboration and isolation between users.

In Linux, permissions control how users interact with files and each other’s work.
Every file and folder has an owner, a group, and others.
Each of them can have different access: read (r), write (w), or execute (x).
This system basically decides who can view, edit, or run something.

When permissions are set so that group members have read and write rights, users can easily work together on the same files.
For example, developers in one team can edit scripts, share results, and update files without asking for root access.
That’s how collaboration happens.

But if permissions are strict, like only the owner has full access, then other users can’t open or touch those files.
This creates isolation — it protects personal files or sensitive data from being changed or even viewed by others.

So in short, permissions define the balance between teamwork and privacy.
If they’re set right, everyone can work smoothly without breaking each other’s stuff.
If not, it either becomes too open (risky) or too closed (inconvenient).
